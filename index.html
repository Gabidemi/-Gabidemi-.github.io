    <h3>Zhongli has left us</h3>
    <h4>My name is Ayo, and i would like to become a video game designer. I have worked in many different externships, such as in cybersecurity, web design and logo designs. My favorite game at the moment is Genshin and I would also like to be hired part time or full time in a good company that values my skills. My favorite places to visit are Florida, Dubai, london and Nigeria. Although Florida and Dubai get expensive after a while, i still enjoyed my stay there and Nigeria is my home country so i would still love to visit. I am currently a senior at Boys and Girls High School and i would like to leave school on a good note.</h4>
